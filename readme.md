#  YM2612 Test Code (AVR / Arduino Uno)

This program tests the [Yamaha YM2612 FM synthesis sound chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2612) by configuring it to sound like a grand piano and cycling a note on and off in a loop. 

The code is designed for an ATmega328/ATmega168 mcu with a 16MHz external crystal. This crystal comes built-in with the [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/arduino-uno-schematic.pdf). 

It has been heavily adopted from test code by Furrtek and [Fabien Batteix](skywodd@gmail.com).
